# More OpSem/Grammar

## Context-Free Grammars (CFGs)

- A CFG is like a regular expression in that it describes a language
- Only need Push-Down Automaton (PDA)
- However, they can also have recursion
- CFGs can only do so much, **Context-Sensitive Grammars** are needed for more complex stuff
- Need the following 4 things for a CFG:
  - Alphabet (capital sigma) - a set of symbols allowed (**terminals**)
  - Non-terminals - groupings of terminals and nonterminals
  - Production - A definition of a non-terminal
  - Starting place
