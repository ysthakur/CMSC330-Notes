# Concurrency

## Threads

Each thread has a separate thread context, including:

- thread ID
- stack
- Registers, including stack pointer and program counter
- Condition codes

Threads share:

- Heap memory
- Global/static memory
- Open files
- Shared libraries
- Virtual address space

## Thread model

- Threads scheduled similarly to processes
  - A thread that performs I/O may be scheduled out of the processor while another
    thread is scheduled in
- No parent-child relationship
  - There is a **main** thread (the first thread)
  - Main thread creates peer thread, then both threads become part of the thread pool
- Context switches between threads much less expansive than those between processes

## POSIX threads (Pthreads)

- The standard interface for C threads

To create threads:

```c
int pthread_create(
  pthread_t *tid, pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*func)(void *), void *arg)
```

- Parameters:
  - `tid` is a pointer to an allocated `pthread_t` that will have the thread ID of
    the new thread placed in it
  - `attr` is a pointer that can be used to change the attributes of the new thread
    - We'll just use `NULL` in 216
  - `func` is a function pointer to the new thread's routine
    - The thread will be executing inside that function
    - It takes a single `void *` parameter that it then casts to whatever it needs
      - Can use struct if you need to pass multiple arguments
    - It returns a `void *`, need to dynamically allocate memory for that
  - `arg` is a pointer that will be passed to the new thread's routine when the
    thread is created
    - This is how you pass arguments to a thread
    - Can use structures to pass multiple arguments
- Returns 0 on success, nonzero on error

## Thread reaping

- When a thread has terminated, information about it, including the thread
  return value, is kept in memory until another thread reaps it
- Threads are reaped by `pthread_join`:

```c
int pthread_join(pthread_t tid, void **val);
```

- Reaps thread with thread ID `tid`
- Blocks until thread `tid` terminates
- Frees memory resources held by thread `tid`
- Returns 0 on success, nonzero on error
- On success, `*val` is the return value of the terminated thread
  - `val` is one of those parameters you return through

## Compiling Pthreads code

- Need the `-lpthread` flag (e.g. `gcc -o threadex threadex.c -lpthread`)
- Can add `-l*` flags to `LDFLAGS` in Makefile
- All the `pthread_*` functions require `#include <pthread.h>`

## Several threads

- If you make threads in a loop and want to pass a pointer to the thread ID variable
  to each thread, you can't pass `&tid` as the arg because the variable keeps changing
  - Instead, you need to make an array of the thread IDs and pass a pointer to that
    (`&tids[i]` or something)

## Thread termination

- Threads can be terminated in one of the four ways:
  - Implicit termination - Thread routine returns, usually what we'll use
  - Explicit termination - Thread calls `pthread_exit()`
  - Process exit - Any thread calls `exit()`, which terminates the process and
    all threads in it
  - Thread cancellation - Another thread calls `pthread_cancel()` to terminate
    a specific thread

## Thread synchronization

- Threads within the same process typically share variables
- Because they execute in interleaved manner, things like incrementing a variable
  may lead to incorrect results
- Want a way for a particular code to only be executed by one thread at a time
- Correct solution uses a **mutex** ("mutual exclusion" lock)
- A binary semaphore (lock) defined in `pthread.h`
- Provides a locking/unlocking mechanism for threads to execute a sequence of code

```c
static pthread_mutex mutex;

pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
/* Write code that you want synchronized here */
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

...
/* In main */
pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL); // We use NULL but we could pass a pointer to control attributes instead
pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex);
```

## Thread safety

- Need to protect shared variables to be thread-safe
- Functions that keep state between invocations are also thread-unsafe
- A **reentrant** function does not rely on shared data
  - All reentrant functions are thread safe, but thread safe functions don't have to be reentrant
- If your code is threaded and relies on an dependable sequence of results, you cannot have global (or static) data accessed by threads
  - Using semaphores helps but still doesn't ensure order
- Functions returning pointers to static data are also not thread-safe
