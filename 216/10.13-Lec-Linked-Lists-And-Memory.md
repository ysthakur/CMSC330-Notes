# Linked lists

```c
typedef struct node {
  int data;
  struct node *next; // Not `Node *next` because `Node` not defined yet
} Node;
```

- Last node is `NULL`
- Use `Node **` instead of `Node *` if any modification is done (because the head itself could be removed/replaced)
- Make sure to `free` when you delete a node

## Reallocation

- If you need more space than originally allocated, can handle yourself:
  - Allocate array twice as large
  - Copy everything over
  - Free original array
- But there's already a function to do this:

```c
void *realloc(void *p, size_t new_size);
```

- Checks current size of the block `p` points to
  - If original size >= `new_size`, can perform reallocation in place, and returns `p`
  - If original size < `new_size`, new block of size `new_size` is allocated
    - If allocation fails, returns `NULL`
    - Otherwise, copies items from `p` over, frees p, and returns pointers to new block

## Operating on blocks of memory

```c
void *memcpy(void *dst, void *src, size_t n);
void *memmove(void *dst, void *src, size_t n);
```

- Both used for copying whole blocks of memory
- Both return destination (`dst`) pointer
- `memcpy` cannot be used on overlapping arrays but it's faster than `memmove`
  - `memmove` uses a buffer first for safety

```c
void *memset(void *dst, int c, size_t n);
```

- Fills the first `n` bytes of the memory pointed to by `dst` with `c` (`c` is a char)
- Include `string.h`
