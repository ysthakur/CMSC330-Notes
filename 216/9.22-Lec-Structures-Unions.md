# Structures and `typedef`

## `typedef`

- Can give types new names

Syntax:

```c
typedef existing-type new-name;
typedef double Dollars;
Dollars x, y = 1.25; // x and y are doubles
```

- Using caps to start `typedef` names helps set them apart from other types
- `#define` and `typedef` are not the same
- Can also define aliases to pointers and stuff (`typedef int* Int_Ptr`)

## Structs

- Like a Java class with no methods

Syntax:

```c
struct tag { member-list };

struct pixel {
  int x, y;
  char color;
};

struct pixel blue_pixel;
blue_pixel.x = 50;
```

- Can have array of structs (`struct pixel bitmap[10]`)
- Can use `typedef` to make using structs easier

```c
typedef struct pixel {
  int x, y;
  char color;
} Pixel;

Pixel blue_pixel;
```

### Struct initialization

- Like array initialization
- Items are assigned to fields in order
- Zeros are used to fill uninitialized fields if not all are given

Example:

```c
Pixel p1 = {1, 2, 'r'};
Pixel p2 = {1};
```

### Struct declarations

- Usually put outside of functions
- Should be in header files if used across multiple files

### Struct assignment

- `a = b` compiles
- Bytes for corresponding fields are copied in an assignment (shallow copy)

---

- `a == b` will not compile
- Struct arguments are passed by value
- `ptr->x` can be used in place of `(*ptr).x`

### Struct storage

- The amount of space a struct takes up isn't just the sum of the members because of alignment issues
- To minimize unused space, order fields from longest to shortest
- Too risky to use pointer arithmetic to access struct fields

## Unions

- Look like structs but all fields share the same memory space, so only as large as the largest field
- Only one field valid at a time
- Use enum to hold type of current field

```c
typedef struct {
   enum { INT, DOUBLE } type;
   union {
      int i;
      double d;
   } value;
} Better_number;
```

---

- Can declare anonymous struct, union, enum variables
- Cannot declare more variables of the same type
- Prevents use as function arguments

```c
struct {
  int foo;
  char last_name[10];
} emp1, emp2;
```
