# Function pointers

Each function is located somewhere in memory, so we can create pointers to them.
Syntax for declaration:

```c
return_type (*name_of_pointer)(parameter_list);
```

- Examples:
  - `void (*fp)(int);` is a pointer to a function that returns `void` and has a single `int` parameter
  - `int *(*fp2)(char *, int)` is a pointer to a function that returns a pointer to an `int` and has
    2 parameters (a pointer to a `char` and an `int`)
- Can refer to functions as `&foo` but `&` not necessary
- Can dereference function pointers as `(*foo)(bar,baz)` but `*` not necessary
- Can use `typedef` with function pointers

```c
typedef char *(*Str_func)(char *); //function taking and outputting strings
```

- Can use as parameter to other function

### `qsort`

```c
void qsort(void *base, size_t nmemb, size_t size, int (*compar)(const void *, const void *));
```

- `qsort` in `stdlib.h` takes a function pointer for comparing elements
- Parameters:
  - `base` takes pointer to start of array
  - `nmemb` is number of elements in array
  - `size` is size of each element in array (in bytes)
  - `compar` is comparison function like Java's `compareTo`
- See `sort_array.c` for an example

Example `compar`:

```c
int compare_ints(const void *x, const void *y) { // can't be int x, int y
  return *(int *)x - *(int *)y; // can't directly subtract voids
}
```
