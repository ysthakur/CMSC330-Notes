# Dynamic memory allocation

## Difference between stack and heap

[Website](https://cs-fundamentals.com/c-programming/memory-layout-of-c-program-code-data-segments.php) with explanation.

### Stack

- Allocated/deallocated in specific order; typically by compiler
- You can only remove from and add to top of stack
- Any item in stack is always freed before item below it
- Useful for local variables since functions work in similar manner
- Starts at 0xffffffff and actually grows downward towards 0x0
- Shrinks as it returns

### Heap

- Can be allocated and deallocated in any order when program is running
- Tends to not shrink

## Garbage collection vs user-managed heap

### Garbage collection

- Convenient, no need for programmer to keep track of objects
- But slow, since collector has to be run periodically
  - Collection also expensive

### User-managed heap

- Programmer can control precise time to deallocate objects
- But requires much more care, need to deallocate the right things at the right time

## Memory management functions

### Allocating memory

- Both require `NULL` if allocation fails
- Both in `stdlib.h`
- Both return contiguous block of memory
- Both return `void *` to cast into whatever you want

```c
void *malloc(size_t amount);
```

- No initialization of space guaranteed (although platform-dependent)

```c
void *calloc(size_t count, size_t obj_size);
```

- Allocates `count` objects of size `obj_size` each, returns pointer to beginning
- Good for arrays
- Initializes all the space to 0

### Deallocating/freeing memory

```c
void free(void *ptr);
```

- Can only call on pointer to memory allocated on **heap** (with `malloc` or `calloc`), not stack
- After `free` call, memory pointed to by `ptr` is now part of pool of free memory, can be reused
  - May be set to 0 or something else depending on platform or whatever
- After calling `free(p)`, `p` still exists and still points to the same memory location, it's just
  that that memory is now released, so you shouldn't try to access it
  - `p` is now a **dangling pointer**
  - You may want to set `p` to `NULL` afterwards just to be safe
- `free(NULL)` is okay (does nothing)
- `free` knows how much memory to make memory available even though you just provide a pointer and not the size
  - This is because when `malloc` and `calloc` allocate memory, the memory allocated is one word bigger than specified memory
  - Extra word used to store allocated memory size

## Common errors

- Dereferencing pointers to freed memory
- Forgetting to check the returned value from `malloc` or `calloc` for `NULL`
- Not initializing the memory `malloc` returns
- Attempting to free non-heap pointer
- Freeing something that's not the beginning of a dynamically allocated block (e.g. `free(p + 1)` instead of `free(p)`)
- Not allocating enough space
  - For strings, use `malloc(string_length + 1)` (`+ 1` necessary for null terminator)
- Using incorrect size for memory allocation
  - Don't mix up `strlen` and `sizeof`
- Memory leaks
  - If you reassign a pointer, make sure to `free` its old value
  - Losing the only pointer to a piece of memory causes a memory leak
  - Not an immediately fatal error but can be a waste of space
  - Can use `valgrind`
    - `--leak-check=full` for details of leaked memory
    - `--track-origins=yes` to track use of uninitialized vlaue
