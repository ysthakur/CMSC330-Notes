# `dup2` and Pipes

## `dup2`

- We mainly use `dup2` to change the default association of `STDIN_FILENO` and
  `STDOUT_FILENO` to a file or pipe end
- This allows us to change what a process uses as input or output
- The process thinks it's using stdin/stdout but by using `dup2` we can actually
  change the data source/destination
- If you have some file descriptor `fd1` pointing to some normal file, then
  `dup2(fd1, STDIN_FILENO);` will "redirect" stdin to that file
  - The file descriptor `0` normally points to stdin but now it points to the same
    open file descriptor that `fd1` points to
  - ref count of original `STDIN_FILENO` decrements
  - Now if someone tries to read from stdin they actually read from `fd1`
- After using `dup2(fd, foo)`, we need to `close(fd)` to avoid resource leak
- Before doing `dup2`, you can save using `int stdout_fd = dup(STDOUT_FILENO);`
  - Can restore afterwards using `dup2(stdout_fd, STDOUT_FILENO); close(stdout_fd);`
    (make sure to close)

## Inter-process communication

- Processes can communicate with each other via various means, including pipes
  and signals
- Signals have a limited "vocabulary" - only 64 signals on some machines, other
  limitations as well
- **Pipes** allow data to be sent from one process to another

### Anonymous pipes

```c
#include <unistd.h>
int pipe(int pipefd[2]);
```

- `pipe` function provides unidirectional IPC (inter-process communication)
  channel, with read end and write end
- Anonymous pipe's file descriptors are only visible in the process that created
  the pipe (and its children)
- Takes an array
  - First element is file descriptor for read end
  - Second element is file descriptor for write end
- Return value is 0 on success, -1 on error
- Makes entry in inode table of type "pipe", both file descriptors point to that

After forking, both parent and child have a copy of the file descriptor table

- Must decide which of the two is reading and which one is writing
- We do so by closing the appropriate file descriptor, e.g. if parent is
    writing, then parent closes `fd[0]` and child closes `fd[1]`

- I/O is blocking
  - `read()` from an empty pipe doesn't return until data is in the pipe
  - `write()` to a full pipe doesn't return until sufficient space exists to
    complete the write
- Reads on the pipe will return `EOF` if no process has the write end open
- Writes to a pipe that has no readers cause an error

- Cannot move file position around (no seeking inside the file)
- Because of blocking I/O, need to close ends of the pipe we're not using, both
  immediately after the fork and once we're finished reading/writing
  - Otherwise `read` won't signal `EOF` properly
  - If program hangs, chances are pipe ends are not closed
