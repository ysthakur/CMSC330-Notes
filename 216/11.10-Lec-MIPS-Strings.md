# String stuff in MIPS

## String input

For reading a string from stdin

### Declare data to hold string

```assembly
    .data
s:  .space 20
```

- `s` is a label for the name of the string
- `.space` specifies an "array"-like data type
- `20` means 20 characters maximum

### Inside function

```assembly
li $v0, 8  # 8 is for reading strings
la $a0, s  # load address of buffer into $a0
li $a1, 20 # load max length of string into $a1
syscall    # execute
```

### Printing strings

```assembly
li $v0, 4  # 4 is for outputting strings
la $a0, s  # load address of string into $a0
syscall    # execute
```

## Accessing characters in strings

- When you do `lw`, it gives you 4 bytes
  - But `char`s are only 1 byte
  - So it gives you 4 chars instead of just one
- This is what `lb` is for
  - `lb rd, offset(rs)`
  - Loads individual byte at address `rs+offset` and stores in `rd`
