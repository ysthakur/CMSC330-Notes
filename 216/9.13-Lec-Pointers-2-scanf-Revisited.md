# `scanf` and pointers

## `scanf` Revisited

- If `scanf` cannot read all the values, it will stop scanning and return how many values it was able to read.
  - `scanf("%d %d", &a, &b)` with input `32 Z` will return 1 and only set `a`

Format specifiers:

- `%c` reads one character
- `%d` reads one integer
- `%lf` reads one double

## Pointer arithmetic

### Incrementing pointers

- When pointers are involved the postfix and prefix operators behave differently
- Postfix operators have higher precedence than the dereference and prefix operators
- Dereference and prefix operators have the same precedence and are right-associative
- `++*p` increments the value at the location to which `p` points and evaluates to that incremented value
- `*++p = 99;` increments the value of `p` and changes the value at the location pointed to by `p`

### Other types of pointer arithmetic

- Indexing is a pointer operation
- Only valid forms of pointer arithmetic:
  - `pointer - pointer`
  - `pointer +/- integer`
- With two pointers in the same array, can determine how far apart they are by subtracting the pointers
  - Allows us to find number of elements
- Can also use relational and equality operators on pointers
  - Can check if reached end of array this way

## Generic pointers

- Pointers defined as `void *` can point to any type
- `void *` pointers don't need casts
- Cannot dereference a `void *` pointer directly
  - Need to cast or assign to real pointer type
  - Value obtained from dereference depends on type of pointer
  - Because you need to know how many bytes it takes up in order to read it
- `NULL` is defined as `(void *) 0`
- Can be used for a kind of poor man's generics

## Arrays vs pointers

- `int nums[3];`
  - Allocates 3 `int`s worth of space, points `nums` to beginning of that space
  - `nums` cannot be modified to point elsewhere
  - By itself `nums` is treated like a constant pointer that points to the beginning of the array
- `int *nump;`
  - Declares pointer, doesn't allocate any space other than to hold an address
  - Connects `nump` to that space
  - `nump` can be changed and assigned a different value
