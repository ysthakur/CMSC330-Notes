# Recursion

## Phases of recursion

### Phase 1 (stack expansion)

- Accumulate all the argument values on the stack as recursive calls are made
- The base case argument value is not put on the stack

### Phase 2 (end of stack expansion)

- We have reached the base case
- Initialize `$v0` to whatever value the function returns for the base case
- Go to the EPILOGUE of `f` (which will in turn go to wherever `$ra` tells it to go)

### Phase 3 (stack is shrinking)

- Read argument value from stack
- Calculate and accumulate into `$v0`
