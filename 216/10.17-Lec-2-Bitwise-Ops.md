# Bitwise operators

- `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`

## Bit masking

- Clear a bit by ANDing it with a 0 (the other digits must be ANDed with 1 to stay the same)
- Check bit by ANDing it with 1
- Toggle bit by XORing it with a 1 (the other digits must be XORed with 0 to stay the same)
- Set bit by ORing it with 1 (the other digits must be ORed with 0 to stay the same)

## Big endian vs little endian

- Endianness - Describes how multi-byte data is stored in memory
  - Describes location of least and most significant byte
  - Dictated by CPU architecture (not OS)
- A **word** is 4 bytes
- An **address** specifies first byte in word
- **Big endian** - "normal" layout of data
  - Least significant byte has *highest* address
  - Example:
    - Assume some word (4 bytes) has value `0xA1CD459B`
    - Assume address of that value is `0xC00`
    - Addresses:
      - A1: `0xC00`
      - CD: `0xC01`
      - 45: `0xC02`
      - 9B: `0xC03` (least significant, highest address)
- **Little endian** is reverse
  - Least significant byte has lowest address
- Endianness only applies to memory, not registers
- Can check if computer is big or little endian by making an `int`, casting pointer to it to `char *` and accessing first byte
