# Strings

- A string is a sequence of `char`s (`char[]`) ending in a NUL character (`'\0'`)
- Can initialize `char[]` with string literal
  - Cannot initialize `char *` with string literal (`char *s = "f";` doesn't compile)
  - However, can initialize `const char *` (`const char *s = "f";` does compile)
- Size of `char[]` needs to account for the null byte (`char a[6] = "hello";`)

## Functions

### `scanf`

- `scanf("%s", str)` doesn't need `&str` because `str` is already an array/pointer

### `strcpy`

- Cannot assign strings like `str = "hi";`
- Use `strcpy(char *dest, const char *src)` instead
- Programmer must ensure `dest` is big enough to hold the characters from `src`
  - Can have buffer overflow otherwise

### `strlen`

- `strlen` gives you size of string by finding where the first null byte is

### `strcmp`

- `strcmp` compares strings in lexicographic order (based on ASCII value)
- Works like `compareTo` in Java
- 0 if equal
- Negative if `s1 < s2`
- Positive if `s1 > s2`

### `sprintf`

- Stores characters into a `char` array

## `ctype.h`

- Provides functions for character types
- Functions take and return `int`s instead of `char`s
