# Time

Different ways of measuring time

- Wall time - Real-world time
- Process time - Time your program was running
  - Doesn't count time when your program was stopped for other programs or for I/O
  - Composed of two things:
    - user time - When the OS is running your code
    - kernel time/system time - When the OS is running system code (handling syscalls)

## Timing a program

- Unix has `time program-name program-arguments` to time a program
- Shows you (in order):
  - User time
  - System time
  - Wall time
  - Percentage of wall time: `(user + system) / wall`
  - Remainder are paging and I/O statistics

## Representing time of day

- Unix keeps track of time internally in seconds
- Begins at midnight on Jan 1, 1970, called the **epoch**
- Keeps all times in UTC form until printed
- No time zones or daylight saving times to deal with

## Date and time functions

- Functions in `<time.h>` for working with times
- Must use `time_t` type that contains encoded representation of time
- Several use the `tm` structure defined in `time.h` that can be extracted from
  a `time_t` variable with the following fields (all `int`s):
  - `tm_sec`
  - `tm_min`
  - `tm_hour`
  - `tm_mday` (day of the month)
  - `tm_mon`
  - `tm_year`
  - `tm_wday` (day of the week)
  - `tm_yday` (day in the year)
  - `tm_isdst` (daylight savings time)
- `clock_t clock(void);` returns the CPU time (ticks) since the start of program execution
  - To convert to time, divide by `CLOCKS_PER_SEC`

```c
int gettimeofday(struct timeval *tv, struct timezone *tz);
```

- Need `#include <sys/time.h>`
- `tv` is a struct of time `tv_sec` (time in seconds) and `tv_usec` (time in microseconds)
- `tz` no longer used (just pass `NULL`)

```c
int getrusage(int who, struct rusage *usage);
```

- Need `sys/time.h`, `sys/resource.h`, and `unistd.h`
- Resource usage
