# Bitwise operators

## Some integer types

- `uint32_t` - unsigned 32 bit int
  - Found in `stdint.h`
- `size_t` - unsigned integer capable of representing the size of the largest possible object in the computer
- `limits.h` file provides size information
  - `/usr/includes/limits.h`

## Bases

- `printf` has format specifiers to allow printing values in hex and octal (but not binary)
  - `%x`/`%X` - hexadecimal (`x` for `a-f`, `X` for `A-F`)
  - `%o` - octal
- `"%08x"` often used for printing `unsigned int`s as zero-padded, 8-digit hex numbers
  - Note that `0x` is not added to the printed value
- `scanf` also has provisions to read hex and octal

## Bit operations

- Numbers represented with fixed number of bits
  - `char`s are 8 bits
  - `int`s are 32 bits
  - `long`s are 32 or 64 bits
- C allows directly manipulating bits of number
  - Easy to accidentally make programs non-portable
- Usually unsigned integers used for bitwise operations

## Shifting operators

- The `<<` and `>>` operators shift a value a given number of bits to the left or right, respectively
- Should only be used with unsigned integer as left operand
- Right operand must be:
  - Between 0 and `(# bits of left operand) - 1`
  - Result is undefined if right operand is greater than or equal to the `# bits of left operand`
- `0` bits replace the vacated bits
- Shifting is like multiplying or dividing by powers of 2
- Notice that operators don't change the left operand
  - Need assignment for that: `<<=` and `>>=`
- Be careful if number is already big
  - `<<` may result in a negative number

## Some more bitwise operators

- NOT (unary): `~`
- XOR: `^`
- Can use them with assignment: `&=`, `^=`, etc.

## Bitmasking

- To clear a bit, AND it with a 0
- To toggle a bit, XOR it with a 1
