## CPU registers

- Registers are fast-access locations accessed by instructions
- Some are general-purpose registers
  - hold operands, addresses of operands


## QtSPIM

- See address in `[]` on left. Each instruction takes up 4 bytes

## Prologue and epilogue

- Always the same
- Need to memorize

### Prologue

```assembly
subu $sp, $sp, 8  # Grow stack by 8 bytes (2 spaces to hold $ra and $fp)
sw   $ra, 8($sp)  # Store return address
sw   $fp, 4($sp)  # Store frame pointer
addu $fp, $sp, 8  # Update frame pointer
```

### Epilogue

```assembly
move $sp, $fp     # Move back to the old frame's end
lw   $ra, ($fp)   # Load the stored return address
lw   $fp, -8($sp) # Load the old frame pointer
jr   $ra          # Go back where it came from
```

## Instructions

- `addi reg1, reg2, constant` - Add immediate
  - Puts `constant + reg2` into `reg1`
- `lb reg1, offset(reg2)` - Load byte
  - Used for reading individual characters
  - Gets the byte at address `reg2+offset` and puts it in `reg1`

## Syscall codes

- 1
- 4
- 8
- 11
