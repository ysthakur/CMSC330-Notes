# Pointers and stuff

- Declare pointers using `int *p;`
- Get value at address using `int i = *p`;
- Get address of variable using `p = &var;`
- `void*` is the type of a generic pointer. You can cast like `(void *) &age` to get rid of type warnings

Example:

```c
int *p;
int age = 21;
p = &age;
age = 18;
// Now *p is also 18
```

## Pass by value

- Everything in C is passed by value
- When an argument is passed to a function, the function gets a copy of it
- So inside a function, arguments will not be modified
- If you want to modify variables, you can pass pointers to functions instead
- scanf also takes pointers as input so that it can set their values

- Do not return pointers to local variables because they're freed at the end of the function

## NULL

- Analogue to Java's `null`
- `NULL` is a pointer to address 0, where nothing is allowed to be stored/accessed
- Can be considered false
- Defined in `stddef.h`, which is included by many other header files
- Segfaults if you try to dereference a `NULL` pointer
- You can assign `NULL` to any type of pointer
- Good idea to check for `NULL` before dereferencing anything

## The `const` modifier

- Order of type specifier and `const` modifier matter when dealing with pointers

```c
int i = 4, j = 5;
const int *p = &i; // pointer to constant int
int* const q = &j; // constant pointer to int
p = &j; // OK
*p += 5; // ERROR
q = &i; // ERROR
*q += 2; // OK
```

## Pointer arithmetic

- `int p; p++` moves `p` 4 bytes down the lane in memory (here, 4 bytes because it's an `int`)
- Can use pointer arithmetic to process an array
- We can use an array name as a pointer
- Cannot do arithmetic on array name, however
