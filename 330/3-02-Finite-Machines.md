# Finite Machines

## Finite State Machines

- FSM
  - Finite memory
- Push-down automaton (PDA)
  - Infinite memory
  - Uses stack
  - Can do more than FSMs
- Turing machine
  - Infinite memory
  - Uses ticker tape
  - Can do more than PDAs

FSMS:

- States with an extra circle around them denote the target
- **Garbage state**: a state where you know you won't be going anywhere
  - Safe to leave out of your graph

## Regex

- E (epsilon) - empty string
- R1R2 - concatenation
- n - n in alphabet
- R1|R2 - branch
- R1* - repetition/Kleene closure
